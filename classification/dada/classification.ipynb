    "### Let's compare the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) solver and the Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**\n",
    "- Addresses optimization problems, especially in large-scale machine learning tasks.\n",
    "- Works well with large and sparse datasets because it updates model parameters incrementally for each data point or batch.\n",
    "- Faster for big data, but may converge less smoothly and requires careful tuning of learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### L-BFGS:**\n",
    "- Also solves optimization problems, but is more suited for smaller datasets and problems where memory is a concern.\n",
    "- Uses approximations to the Hessian matrix to find the optimal solution efficiently.\n",
    "- Converges smoothly and often requires fewer iterations, but can be slower and more memory-intensive for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why pick one over another?**\n",
    "- Choose SGD for large, streaming, or sparse data where speed is critical.\n",
    "- Choose L-BFGS for smaller, dense datasets where smooth convergence and fewer iterations are desired."
