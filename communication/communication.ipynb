    "#### FER 2013 Dataset\n",
    "The FER 2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of affective computing. Comprising over 35,000 labeled grayscale facial images (48Ã—48 pixels) categorized into seven emotion classes (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral), this dataset offers a structured yet complex lens into human emotion. It provides a compelling foundation for building systems that aim to understand subtle emotional cues, a critical capability in areas such as mental health, human-computer interaction, and online education.\n"

    "\n",
    "Through my research, I hope that the FER 2013 dataset can reveal not just how deep learning models recognize basic emotions, but also how these emotions evolve in educational settings. By mapping basic emotions to more complex learning-related emotions (e.g., boredom, confusion, interest), the dataset may serve as a proxy for understanding student engagement and cognitive load. If successful, it could help educators adapt their teaching strategies in real time and improve learning outcomes in virtual environments.\n",
